# Secure Software Development - Vulnerability Assessment and Remediation

## Overview

This repository contains the work completed as part of the Secure Software Development (SSD) module, focusing on identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in a web application. The assessment highlights various security vulnerabilities and implements solutions to enhance the overall security posture of the application.

## Objectives

- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the application.
- Implement fixes to remediate identified vulnerabilities.
- Enhance authentication mechanisms with OAuth for secure user login.

## Tools Used

- **SonarQube**: Utilized for static code analysis to identify code quality issues and vulnerabilities in the application.
- **OWASP ZAP**: Employed for dynamic application security testing to find vulnerabilities in real-time during the applicationâ€™s execution.

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Implemented JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication to secure admin login and signup functionalities.
- **OAuth Integration**: Added Google and Facebook OAuth authentication for user sign-in, providing a secure and user-friendly login experience.
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling to ensure sensitive information is not exposed through error messages.
- **CORS Configuration**: Set up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to restrict access to the API from specific domains, enhancing security against cross-origin attacks.
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect endpoints from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
- **Token Management**: Introduced token blacklisting and refresh token mechanisms to enhance session management and security.

## Vulnerabilities Addressed

1. **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Ensured that sensitive data, such as passwords, are not sent to the client and are hashed securely.
2. **SQL Injection**: Implemented prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
3. **Lack of Token Management**: Added functionality to blacklist tokens upon logout and manage access tokens and refresh tokens effectively.
4. **Improper Error Handling**: Implemented comprehensive error handling to prevent leakage of sensitive information.
